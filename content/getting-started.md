## Overview

Intersective designers use a variety of tools to facilitate a collaborative workflow. These include:

- Mock-up with Sketch
- Mood-boarding and flow prototyping with Invision
- Behavior prototyping in Principle, Flinto or Origami
- Animation in Adobe After Effects and Haiku
- Documentation and research captured in Atlassian, G Suite and Coda
- Shared storage in Dropbox
- Team communication in Slack and Zoom

Note: Make sure you have been properly onboarded and have access to all the above tools and software. Talk to the person you report to.
