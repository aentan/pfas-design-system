Tabs organize content across different screens, data sets, and other interactions.

Tabs are:

- Used to organize and allow navigation between groups of content
- Tabbed content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy
- Labels should be short and succinct
- Always be in a single row
- Aligned to the bottom of its parent container

## Text Tabs

Text tabs should almost always be used in web/desktop interfaces.

{{< component-figure src="/img/components/tabs/text tabs.png" >}}
  Left-aligned text tabs
{{< /component-figure >}}

{{< component-figure src="/img/components/tabs/text tabs centered.png" >}}
  Center-aligned text tabs
{{< /component-figure >}}

Text tabs have active indicator bars. Position the tab so that the tab and indicator bar are bottom-aligned to the parent container.

Whether to use left-aligned or center-aligned tabs is left to the designerâ€™s discretion. The ideal layout should take into consideration the overall grid and the spatial relation between individual elements.

## Icon + Text Tabs

Icon + text tabs are primarily used where space is constrainted, i.e. mobile device.

{{< component-figure src="/img/components/tabs/icon label tabs.png" >}}
  Icon + text tabs
{{< /component-figure >}}

This style of tabs is usually preferred over icon-only tabs because of added usability. Note there is no active indicator.

## Icon-only Tabs

Icon-only tabs are primarily used where space is constrainted, i.e. mobile device.

{{< component-figure src="/img/components/tabs/icon tabs.png" >}}
  Icon-only tabs
{{< /component-figure >}}

Use this style of tabs only when the icons are very well-understood.
