PFAS layouts share Material Design principles. The following pages will guide you in creating mobile, web app and website layouts that are consistent, visually appealing and structurally sound.

## Principles

- UIs should use intuitive and predictable layouts, with consistent UI regions and spatial organization
- Layouts should use a consistent grid, keylines, and padding
- Layouts are adaptive and react to input from the user, device, and screen elements

## Structure

Like Material Design layouts, PFAS layouts should be visually balanced. The base unit of measurement in a PFAS layout is 8dp. This applies to the dimensions of components, spacing within the arrangement of components and the overall layout.

Smaller components, such as iconography and typography, can use a base of 4dp.
