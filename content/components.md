PFAS components are shared across all platforms â€“ mobile (iOS and Android) and web. The advantage of a single design language across all platforms allows us to save time and effort by designing only once.

Although iOS and Android have their own interface nuances, they have converged significantly over the past couple of years as it has became clear what effective UI elements should look and work. The visual differences are now only skin-deep.

Please consult the subsequent pages for guidelines on individual components.
