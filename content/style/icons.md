Practera UI icons uses bold geometric shapes to visually represent core ideas, capabilities, or topics with as little complexity as possible.

## UI Icons

A UI icon symbolizes a command, file, device, or directory. UI icons are also used to represent common actions performed within Practera. The design of our UI icons is simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, with every idea edited to its essence. They are designed to be true to platform aesthetics.

Material Design icons are used in both Android and iOS. When custom icons are needed, they are crafted to fit precisely to Material Design specifications.

  The icon grid establishes clear rules for the consistent, but flexible, positioning of graphic elements.

  Keyline shapes are the foundation of the grid. By using these core shapes as guidelines, you can maintain consistent visual proportions across system icons.

## Custom Icons

The Material Design icon set does not and cannot provide all the icons that we will ever need. The PFAS icon set contains custom icons that are specific to the topic experiential learning and Practera, which are not available elsewhere.

If you need to create additional custom icons, design them according the Material Design icon grid and keylines. Remember to also add them to the icon Sketch library (referenced below).
