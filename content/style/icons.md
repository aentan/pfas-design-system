Practera UI icons uses bold geometric shapes to visually represent core ideas, capabilities, or topics with as little complexity as possible.

## UI Icons

A UI icon symbolizes a command, file, device, or directory. UI icons are also used to represent common actions performed within Practera. The design of our UI icons is simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, with every idea edited to its essence. They are designed to be true to platform aesthetics.

  The icon grid establishes clear rules for the consistent, but flexible, positioning of graphic elements.

  Keyline shapes are the foundation of the grid. By using these core shapes as guidelines, you can maintain consistent visual proportions across system icons.
