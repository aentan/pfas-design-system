<p class="lead">The PFAS Design System is a living decree containing design guidelines, specifications and assets, created to help Practera designers and developers achieve product polish.</p>

## Why a Design System?

Designers can stop worrying about minute details like fonts and colors every time they create, and instead focus on larger things like the delivery of the experience. Developers can have a collection of reusable interface elements and avoid reinventing the wheel each time. Overall, people can focus more on solving customer problems than engineering problems.

## As a Design Language

**PFAS** stands for **P**ractera **F**uture **A**esthetic **S**tudy. It started as an study to envision how Practera would look and feel if it was tomorrowâ€™s product.

> A **design language** or **design vocabulary** is an overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a complement of products or architectural settings. Designers wishing to give their suite of products a unique but consistent look and feel define a design language for it, which can describe choices for design aspects such as materials, colour schemes, shapes, patterns, textures, or layouts. They then follow the scheme in the design of each object in the suite.
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language))

There are three principles that define the PFAS design language.

### Soul

{{% image-figure src="/img/home/soul.gif" %}}
  A PFAS interface has a pulse, seems to be alive, appears conscious and in thought. It is rarely static. Being alive, its motions are smooth and organic.

  - Use smooth transitions
  - Be visually generous with activity indicators
  - Show progress actively

### Synthetic

{{% image-figure src="/img/home/color.jpg" %}}
  A PFAS interface is a synthetic lifeform and does not bother to over-dress itself. It does not cover up the artificial materials that make up its form.

  - Light, synthetic surfaces
  - Accent with vibrant, fluorescent hues
  - Lighten by decreasing opacity
  - Soft shadows

### Organic

{{% image-figure src="/img/home/human.png" %}}
  A PFAS interface supports and communicates content that is organic, in stark, dichotomically balanced contrast with its synthetic parts.

  - Human, emotive, friendly writing style
  - Hand-drawn illustrations
  - Empathic User Experience
