<p class="lead">The PFAS Design System is a living decree containing design guidelines, specifications and assets, created to help Practera designers and developers achieve product polish.</p>

## Why a Design System?

Designers can stop worrying about minute details like fonts and colors every time they create, and instead focus on larger things like the delivery of the experience. Developers can have a collection of reusable interface elements and avoid reinventing the wheel each time. Overall, people can focus more on solving customer problems than engineering problems.
