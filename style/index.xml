      <description>Practera UI icons uses bold geometric shapes to visually represent core ideas, capabilities, or topics with as little complexity as possible.
UI Icons A UI icon symbolizes a command, file, device, or directory. UI icons are also used to represent common actions performed within Practera. The design of our UI icons is simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, with every idea edited to its essence.</description>

      <description>The PFAS type system borrows heavily from the default Material Design type system. Besides the specific nuances described below, consult the Material Design typography guidelines for what you should do when it comes to setting type.
Fonts Roboto Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width.</description>
